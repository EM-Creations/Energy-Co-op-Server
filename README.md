<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Energy Co-op Server Screen Shot](https://github.com/EM-Creations/Energy-Co-op-Server/blob/main/public/demo.jpg)](https://github.com/EM-Creations/Energy-Co-op-Server)

Energy Co-op Server is intended to be a Spring Boot server backend to facilitate the management of users accessing Energy Co-op information.
This application is designed to run in conjunction with the [Energy Co-op UI](https://github.com/EM-Creations/Energy-Co-op-UI).

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Java JDK 21+
* PostgreSQL 17+ database
* Vensys API keys
* Auth0 account
* [UI Project setup](https://github.com/EM-Creations/Energy-Co-op-UI)
* [Podman (optional)](https://podman-desktop.io/)

### Auth0 setup
Authentication is managed from the UI side, the server side checks permissions and that the token from the UI is valid.
1. Create an Auth0 account at [Auth0](https://auth0.com/)
2. Create a new application in the Auth0 dashboard
3. Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:4200`
4. Set the logout URL to `http://localhost:4200`
5. Copy the domain, client id and secret from the Auth0 application settings
6. Update the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file with the Auth0 details, issuer is the domain, client id and
secret are the client id and secret from the Auth0 application settings
7. Create a new API in the Auth0 dashboard and enable RBAC, then set the identifier to a URL (it does not need to be accessible)
8. Update the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file with the Auth0 API identifier as the audience
9. Lastly, create a new Action Trigger for "post-login" in the Auth0 dashboard, this will be used to add the user's email to the token.
   - Use the following code in the Action Trigger:
```javascript
exports.onExecutePostLogin = async (event, api) => {
  const namespace = 'ownerships';
  const { ownerships } = event.user.app_metadata;

  if (event.authorization) {
    // Add site ownership details to the ID token
    api.idToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}`, ownerships);

    // Add site ownership details to the access token (may not be required)
    api.accessToken.setCustomClaim(`${namespace}`, ownerships);
  }
};
```

### Installation and development

1. [Install Java 21+](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk#zulu)
2. Clone a fork of this repository
3. Update the values in the `src/main/resources/application.yml` file as needed (okta oauth2 auth0, api details etc).
4. Build and run all tests
```bash
gradle clean build
```
5. Create a Run Configuration to run the `gradle bootRun` task
6. Check the server is running by going to the [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html) or the [H2 database console](http://localhost:8080/h2-console/)

### Testing the API
1. The API can be tested by first running the UI, logging in and getting the access token
(you can find this by opening the network tab and finding the response to the Auth0 login)
2. Then use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), set the authorisation to "Bearer Token" and paste the access token into the field
3. Then configure the Postman request to point to the API endpoints you want to test

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
gradle bootRun
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/), use the following command:

```bash
gradle clean build
```

## Building a Podman image
1. First build the project using Gradle:
```bash
gradle clean build
```
2. Download and install [Podman Desktop](https://podman-desktop.io/)
3. Open Podman Desktop
4. Go to Containers > Create
5. Choose "Containerfile or Dockerfile"
6. Select the `Containerfile` in the root of this repository as the Containerfile path
7. Give the image a name, e.g. `energy-coop-server` and build it
8. When running the image, set the port mapping to `8080:8080` on the "Basic" tab
9. Click "Start Container" to run the server

<!-- DEPLOYMENT SETUP -->
## Deployment Setup
The application is designed to be deployed via OCI images using Podman or Docker on hosting platforms such as [Railway](https://railway.com/), [Render](https://render.com/) and [Coolify](https://coolify.io/) (and has been tested on these too). These steps detail configuration necessary on these hosting platforms.
1. Create an account on your chosen hosting platform or install it on your own hardware (in the case of Coolify).
2. Create 2 docker / OCI image applications to be deployed. One pointing to the server's image and one pointing to the UI's image.
3. Create a Postgres 17 database and make note of its connection details (username, password, URL etc..).

### UI Setup
1. Modify the `environment.ts` file in the UI project to point the `api -> baseURL` value to the deployed server's URL (get this from your hosting platform).
2. Ensure the UI image is exposed on port 80 on the hosting platform.
3. Save, commit, push, wait for the GitHub action to complete (this will update the latest image) and re-deploy it on the hosting platform.

### Backend Setup
1. Modify the `application.yml` file in the server project to include the `allowedOrigins` URL of the deployed UI application (get this from your hosting platform).
2. Ensure the backend image is exposed on port 8080 on the hosting platform.
3. Save, commit, push, wait for the GitHub action to complete (this will update the latest image) and re-deploy it on the hosting platform.
4. You now need to set the following environment variables on your hosting platform for the backend application:
```bash
     API_GRAIG_FATHA_KEY="XXX" # Graig Fatha API key
     API_GRAIG_FATHA_TID="XXX" # Graig Fatha TID
     API_GRAIG_FATHA_URL="XXX" # Graig Fatha API URL
     AUTH0_AUDIENCE="http://XXX:XX/" # This will be whatever audience you setup in the Auth0 setup
     AUTH0_CLIENT_ID="XXX" # Get this from Auth0 settings
     AUTH0_ISSUER="https://XXX/" # Get this from Auth0 settings
     AUTH0_SECRET="XXX" # Get this from Auth0 settings
     DB_PASSWORD="XXX" # Get this from the hosting platform
     DB_URL="jdbc:postgresql://xxx:5432/xx" # Get this from the hosting platform, normally Postgres hostname, port and database name
     DB_USER="XXX" # Get this from the hosting platform
     SITE_CAPACITY_GF="XXX" # Default capacity for Graig Fatha site
     SITE_RATES_GF="XXX" # Default savings rate for Graig Fatha site
     ALERTS_ENABLED="false" # True or false
     ALERTS_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL="https://discord.com/api/webhooks/XXX/XXX" # Discord webhook URL for alerts
     ALERTS_THRESHOLDS_AVAILABILITY="75.0" # Availability threshold percentage for alerts
     ALERTS_THRESHOLDS_FAILURE_TIME="3600.0" # Failure time threshold (seconds) for alerts
```
5. Restart the backend application to apply the environment variable changes.

### Auth0 Setup
1. In the Auth0 dashboard, go to Applications > APIs -> UI Application and add the deployed UI application's URL to the `Allowed Callback URLs`, `Allowed Logout URLs` and `Allowed Web Origins`.
2. Save
3. In the Auth0 dashboard, go to Applications > APIs -> Backend Application and add the deployed UI application's URL to the `Allowed Callback URLs`, `Allowed Logout URLs` and `Allowed Web Origins`.
4. Save
